                <h2>Finding simplicity in life</h2>
                <p><strong>Life can get complicated really quickly</strong>, but it doesn't have to be! There are many
                    ways to simplify your life, <a href="#">a few of which we've explored in the past</a>. This week
                    we're taking a bit of a approach though, in how you can find simplicity in the life you already
                    living.</p>

                    <p>Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be healthy, you have to eat
                        healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.</p>

                    <h2>Simplicity and work</h2>
                    <p>Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their relationship with
                        others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help
                        balance everything out.</p>

                    <h2>Simple decorations</h2>
                    <p>A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't decorate, or they go
                        overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the
                        eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before.</p>
